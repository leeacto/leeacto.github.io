      | Ruby
      li.comment
        | Most of my work is in Ruby. I enjoy its expressiveness, though I wish it were more opinionated at times. I think that this could produce cleaner code.
    li
      | Rails
      li.comment
        | Since I usually work in Ruby, it makes sense that I have a Rails backend. I have enjoyed my recent experience with Service Oriented Architecture.
    li 
      | JavaScript
      li.comment
        | I mainly use Object Oriented JavaScript with jQuery, but some work is done in CoffeScript as well.
    li
      | Testing
      li.comment
        | At times, I implement TDD, but I'll usually test what I deem is important (response codes, database changes, record retrievals). I've tested with RSpec and Jasmine.
