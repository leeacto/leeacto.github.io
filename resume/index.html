  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>I am a recent graduate of Chicago’s Dev Bootcamp, a nine-week that teaches proper web development. I love that coding allows me to find creative solutions to problems. My ideal workplace has a supportive team that requires my best effort every day.</p>

  <h4>Skills</h4>
  <ul class="skills">
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
      <li class="comment">DBC teaches development from the ground up. I learned the basics of Ruby and SQL weeks before typing the words "rails new." I even worked on replicating basic ActiveRecord methods in SQL to understand what AR's actual function.</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li class="comment">JS was taught in layers - initially, all work was in the "$(document).ready()" function; then, our programs were made to be Object-Oriented. Throughout the process, jQuery selectors were used to manipulate the DOM. Since my JS interactions are becoming more dependent on DOM elements, I am looking into frameworks like Backbone and Angular.</li>
    <li>Testing</li>
      <li class="comment">I tested Ruby code with RSpec and JS code with Jasmine. I enjoy Test Driven Development because it forces me to think about the structure and security of my code. </li>
    <li>Deployment</li>
      <li class="comment">Git/GitHub was used for version control. Projects advanced when branched Pull Requests passed Travis CI tests and code reviews. Bug-free products were continuously deployed to Heroku in order to catch any development vs. production changes.</li>
  </ul>
