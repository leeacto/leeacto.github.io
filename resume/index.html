<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>I am a recent graduate of Chicagoâ€™s Dev Bootcamp, a nine-week that teaches proper web development. Since then I have fallen in love with coding. Before DBC, I was a business analyst, but the best part of my job was when I built tools to help people. What I love about coding (in any language) is that problems have multiple answers. I have fun finding the best solution. I want to work with a team that pushes me every day so we can build great products.</p>
