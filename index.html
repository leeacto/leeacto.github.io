    Hey, I'm Nick! I just finished an awesome Ruby on Rails program at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> and I'm excited to keep learning. I program in Ruby, SQL, and Javascript, but I'll do some Visual Basic if you twist my arm.

    There are two main reasons why I love to code: I can stretch my imagination, and I can combine my interests. Software and Web Development is broad that I don't think I'll ever get bored. I'm just a beginner, but I'm learning more every day
